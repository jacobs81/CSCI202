        My College Experience
    </h1>
    I started as a Running Start Student, who wanted to go into Computer Science. <br>
    I took a java course at my community college, <br>
    and then random other courses to finish my Associate degree in Science. <br>
    I transferred to Western for the Fall of 2020, the first full year of COVID school. <br>
    My experience taking 3 CS classes online was extremely unpleasant for me. <br>
    I had decided that CS was not for me. <br>
    Fall 2021 was a hybrid learning environment and I was not sure if i should continue. <br>
