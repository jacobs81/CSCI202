        My College Experience
    </h1>
    <a href="index.html">Go back</a> <br>
    I started as a Running Start Student, who wanted to go into Computer Science. <br>
    I took a java course at my community college, <br>
    and then random other courses to finish my Associate degree in Science. <br>
    I transferred to Western for the Fall of 2020, the first full year of COVID school. <br>
    My experience taking 3 other CS classes online was extremely unpleasant for me. <br>
    Fall 2021 was a hybrid learning environment. <br> 
    I decided to live in the dorms as my first true college experience. <br>

    Which was a difficult change in my life. I also switch majors to Applied Mathematics. <br>
    I continued through Fall of 2022 and ran into Brian Hutchinson at Data and Donuts, <br>
    I generally do not interact with tabling, <br>
    but as a college student I could not pass up on some free food, 
    <a href="third.html">especially donuts.</a> <br>
