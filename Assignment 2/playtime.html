                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong> One of my high school friends showed me Rust about 8 years ago. I bought it while I was still playing video games on my parent's old PC. I could technically run it, but it did not run well enough to play. I had to wait about year until I could build and play on my computer to truly play Rust. Rust holds a special place in my heart cause it was the first game that I truly enjoyed and could play everyday all day as you can probably tell. I have played Rust with hundreds of other people and made connects with everyone. I do not have the time to play Rust anymore but I still talk to many of the people that I played rust with 8 years ago.

                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong> I started playing Escape from Tarkov(EFT) during the Spring of 2020, during the COVID pandemic. I also streamed EFT on twitch during COVID since I had extra time at home. I ended up gathering a following on Twitch from EFT and ended up making affiliate on Twitch. This really helped me stay positive during a hard time since I was able to interact with many different people everyday about something that we enjoyed.

                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong> The GPU in my computer was faulty and started crashing so I had to send it back under warranty for repairs. In the meanwhile I replaced it with a much slower and older GPU. My brother had found Due Process and was playing it competitively so I gave it a try since my PC with the older GPU could run it. I ended up liking the game and started playing with all of the competitive players. I joined a competitive team and played with them for a year until the developers changed the direction of the game and lost the competitive community.

                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong> When I was young my parents got me and my brother laptops that were very basic. We could only play simple and not graphics intensive games. One of my long time childhood friends showed us the game Unturned. We gave it a shot and played a bunch on a private server using Logmein Hamachi. I also played in a tournament hosted my a YouTuber name P9nda in the arena mode, but sadly the tournament had problems and never happened. This was also almost the start of my competitive video game time.

                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong> I originally started playing League of Legends(LOL) with a high school friend. I have most played LOL as a way to connect with my friends and the people I meet at school. I generally enjoy the game but it can be one of the most frustrating and disappointing game that I have ever played.

                    <strong>Personal Connection:</strong> I first played 7 Days to Die at my friend's house on his Xbox 1. In my opinion the Xbox port of the game was not as good as the PC version of the game. It felt janky and did not run well on Xbox split screen. I found Youtube videos on the PC version of the game and I really enjoyed watching the gameplay. I bought the PC version and play it on and off when I do not want to play multiplayer games.

My friends are in the top 500 players of the ranked part of the game and if I had more time, I might be playing The Finals competitively with my old Due Process friends.
