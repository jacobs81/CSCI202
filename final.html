        My College Experience
    </h1>
    <a href="third.html">Go back</a> <br>
    I started as a Running Start Student, who wanted to go into Computer Science. <br>
    I took a java course at my community college, <br>
    and then random other courses to finish my Associate degree in Science. <br>
    I transferred to Western for the Fall of 2020, the first full year of COVID school. <br>
    My experience taking 3 other CS classes online was extremely unpleasant for me. <br>
    Fall 2021 was a hybrid learning environment. <br> 
    I decided to live in the dorms as my first true college experience. <br>
    Which was a difficult change in my life. I also switch majors to Applied Mathematics. <br>
    I continued through Fall of 2022 and ran into Brian Hutchinson at Data and Donuts, <br>
    an event for showing of Western's new program, Data Science. <br>
    Considering my classes for my CS minor and my math degree, <br>
    I only needed 8 classes for a second degree in Data Science. <br>
    I was skeptical from my time in CS, but I gave it a go starting DATA 311 that winter. <br>
    I loved it so I confirmed with the Data Science advisor and applied to the degree. <br>
    I was accepted! I set out my course schedule to graduate with both degrees in the Spring of 2024! <br>
    After finding my schedule I realized I had space to add extra classes. <br>
    I realized that I did not know how to make a website or build a program, <br>
    so I decided to take CS 102, 202, and 348 to learn about building websites. <br>
    Now, you are to the present, I am taking CS 202 and 348 right now. <br>
    If everything goes to plan I will graduate Spring of 2024! <br>
